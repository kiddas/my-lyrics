<pre>Oh
Whoa
This world is so ice
This world is so cold (so cold)
This world is ice cold (ice cold)
This world is ice cold (ice cold)
This world is so ice (ice)
World is so cold (cold)
World is ice cold (ice cold)
This world is ice cold (ice cold)

I swear I got plenty niggas mad, never comin' home
Demons in my head, I got too many niggas gone
Kids out here dyin', mama hurt, cryin'
I ain't even think I'd see eighteen and I ain't lyin'
Jails multiplyin', change shit, I'm tryin'
Murder rate just keep on goin' up, it's horrifyin'
Cops pointin' fingers, they be misidentifyin'
Pocket of change, honestly don't think it's ever gon' change
Lookin' from my new perspective, I done realized some things
Them streets bad, streets wicked (bad)
Streets bad (bad), streets wicked (bad)
If the ray shot hit you, that's a one-way ticket (one-way)
Somethin' don't work a couple times, better fix it
I been to myself, I been just stackin' up my digits
All I could do is preach and I hope you niggas with it

So I like to spread the love
I feel your pain, you just wait your turn
No givin' up
Hopefully one day, your life see a turn
I been to hell and back a few times
Know what it is, get back, I don't mind
Tired of this pain
Tired of this pain

Tryna balance imperfections in my life and do some good ones
Never knew my father, mama told me I'm a hood son
I done been through a lot of rough times, it was hard
That's just one of the reasons I'ma take it so far
So much shit that I hold back, memories, cold facts
They just took my nigga, he got caught up with no strap
It's just been so wack, I just want bro back
I swear to God, we livin' in a cold, cold world
Boogie to the face to calm my feelings, I'm a stoner
Can't go to them trenches, it be hot like Arizona
JT my aroma, city got corona
Sad to say I know like just two niggas with diplomas
First time gettin' sentenced, I was thirteen
First time ever gettin' knocked, I was twelve
When I came home, young nigga, I was fourteen
Went back two more years, oh, wow
'Member when they kicked me out of school, got expelled
They said that I won't be shit, I know only time will tell
Young nigga goin' up, up, up
I know them higher powers lookin' over, that's for sure
So I like to spread the love
I feel your pain, you just wait your turn
No givin' up
Hopefully one day, your life see a turn
I been to hell and back a few times
Know what it is, get back, I don't mind
Tired of this pain
Tired of this pain

So I like to spread the love
I feel your pain, you just wait your turn
No givin' up
Hopefully one day, your life see a turn
I been to hell and back a few times
Know what it is, get back, I don't mind
Tired of this pain (ice cold)
Tired of this pain (ice cold)
